About Cleverific

What's it like to work in engineering at Cleverific?

Inclusive culture. Our customers come from all backgrounds, from all around the world. We're committed to building an actively inclusive and progressive work environment that makes Cleverific an excellent home for everyone.

Ownership. Engineers are involved early in project planning and own projects from end-to-end. Rather than participate in tedious planning and estimate exercises, you'll learn about the full context of the project and take ownership for ensuring that the work gets done. You'll be expected to take responsibilities for the stated priorities of your projects while keeping in mind the needs of the team beyond your own role.

Focus time. We hate meetings. On most days, our office is just a nice quiet place with minimal interruptions so you can focus on getting your best work done and collaborate with whoever you need to.

Ship first. We ship prototypes as early as possible. We favor working software in any state over status reports and gantt charts.

What's it like to work at Cleverific?

Cleverific is a fully bootstrapped, profitable software company with no plans to take venture capital. This is a deliberate choice that allows us to make decisions in our best interests and our customers’ best interests. We'll never have to worry about fundraising rounds or the whims of a VC-packed board of directors. But this doesn’t mean we’re not ambitious. Our revenue doubled last year and we’re aiming to more than double again this year. You’ll fit right in with us if you want to be part of this kind of growth.

We’re committed generalists, eager learners, conscientious workers, and curators of what’s essential. Our workplace and our benefits are designed to support a sustainable, healthy relationship with your work.

Work-life balance. You'll work no more than 40 hours a week on a regular basis so you'll have time to pursue your other interests and responsibilities outside of work.

Unlimited PTO. We don't have any rules or accruals for how much time you can take per year. You're encouraged take regular vacations after important deadlines to come back refreshed, with new ideas and enthusiasm.

9x9 schedule. We take every other Friday off to take advantage of our lives in beautiful, sunny Santa Barbara. We use these days for personal appointments, sleeping in, wine tasting, long workouts, anything—it's a bonafide day off. Some of us still choose to work on select projects that are otherwise hard to prioritize.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box.
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Why Cisco:

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!",4.1,"Cisco Systems - Engineering - Software

Software Engineer,$42K-$91K (Glassdoor est.),"At Kin, we’re looking for self-motivated thinkers ready to make a change for our customers. We value tackling challenges and breaking down walls – but being chill about it.

Kin Insurance is an insurtech startup that sells affordable, user-friendly homeowners insurance. Unlike many startups that gather users and figure out how to be profitable later, we are selling a product that homeowners need and depend on now. We’re innovating in an industry largely untouched by tech, so we are always thinking big.

We believe autonomy is key to job satisfaction, which is why we say the person closest to the problem should solve it. It’s also why we offer unlimited vacation time: we trust in our team to manage their own projects and time. If you want the chance to develop your skills, work with some of the best minds in the industry, and see what you’re really capable of, come learn and grow with us.

About the Development Team

You’ll be part of a growing company and a growing but lean development team. In practice, that means you’ll have the support you need to get your work done, but you’ll also have to be familiar with the whole code base and all of our products and services. Our team is business-minded, so everyone has good working knowledge about the company, fundraising, and the insurance industry. The dev team is also cross-functional, so you’ll work with our insurance experts, quality assurance, product team, and operations very closely.

We’re very product-focused and don’t let tech fads get in the way of shipping new features—but we also value clean code, automated testing, and other sustainable practices.

In short: we move fast, are excited about the work we do, and don’t let non-essentials get in the way of building great products.

So, What’s the Role?

You will collaborate daily with various members of our development team, creating and modifying software to improve our customers’ experience. Our main goal at Kin is to make insurance accessible and affordable, and much of this stems from innovation and efficiency.

Essential Functions and Job Responsibilities:
Provide comprehensive operational and maintenance support to three MARFORRES web based application systems: 1) Memorandum Fiscal Services (MFS); 2) Training, Exercise and Employment Program (TEEP), Transportation of people, and transportation of things (T3); and MFR Manpower. Below is a brief description of each of the applications.

MFS is the primary MARFORES financial system used to integrate diverse data from external systems. MFS delivers a wide span of support covering multiple functional areas within the MARFORRES financial community such as the following: budgeting support, authorization funding management, conference request routing, unit travel card processing, transactional research/validation, financial reporting, billing reconciliation, Defense Travel System account management, and evaluation assessments. MFS is a web based system supporting more than 500 active users throughout the continental United States in support of the MARFORRES financial community. MFS is an ever-evolving financial tool designed to provide accurate and expedient budgeting and accounting information to assist managers in making informed decisions effecting the command’s financial posture. With Business Process Reengineering as the main focus of MFS, the system is designed to fill capability gaps, automate and streamline workflows, and provide integrated reporting capabilities. MFS is agile and able to adapt quickly to the changing DoD financial landscape as new requirements and policy changes must be incorporated into the system to ensure compliancy. MFS is a primary facilitating system for MARFORRES in audit support by offering document retention and rapid retrieval capabilities. MFS has three major external data feeds and two additional internal data exchanges which are processed daily from these Marine Corps systems: SMARTS, MROWS, and GCSS-MC. Currently there are 4 data exchanges, 3 are one-directional (incoming) and one interface is bi-directional. Once the data is received, MFS runs an integration processing job to prepare this data for end users every morning. On average annually, the MFS programming cycle includes 3-4 major projects (greater than two weeks design phase – 4 weeks in the development phase) and roughly 8 minor projects (under two weeks in duration). The new development requirements range from cosmetic modifications to major modular rewrites based on the prioritization of the MARFORRES MFS Configuration Control Board. In addition, there are several items that fall outside of the normal System Development Life Cycle that require support such as: COOP preparation, ADHOC reporting support, system/network troubleshooting, and tasks required to maintain the system’s Authority to Operate (ATO). The contractor should be familiar with T-SQL DB and ASP.NET Web Forms in VB to work within the MFS program.

T3 is a web based system designed to be a Commander’s TEEP management and transportation management tool, capable of identifying unit, personnel, equipment, and resources prior to the execution of training exercises or deployments COMMARFORRES is responsible for the training and the operational readiness of 39,000 Marine Reservists. MARFORRES G-3/5 is responsible for managing a financial database that integrates Operating Budgets with training and exercises, which result in resource utilization over time. Resources are defined as units and their associated personnel, equipment, and funding. The MARFORRES G-3/5 Department provides budgeting, accounting, execution and financial support services through the T3 Database to four Major Subordinate Commands (4th Marine Aircraft Wing, 4th Marine Division, 4th Marine Logistics Group, and the Force Headquarters Group) in addition to many major programs managed at the headquarter level. A major challenge facing the MARFORRES G-3/5 is the geographical dispersion of the more than 160 sites throughout the United States.

The MFR IRR Management Application is a web based system designed to maintain accurate and current personnel records on members of the Individual Ready Reserve Components, to include mailing address, physical condition, military qualifications, dependency status, civilian occupational skills, availability for service, and other information that is needed to determine strength levels of the Military Services.

The development team in coordination with the Marine Forces Reserve Server/Network personnel to conduct the user acceptance testing, performance, and load testing of the applications. Release notes are published to the home page of each application. Currently there are no set monthly release scheduled for changes to production. In the current environment MFR follows an agile schema, sprints are anywhere from 2-6 weeks, and depends on the complexity of the project.

The demands on each application translate to a functionality backlog of 50-100 items varying in levels of complexity. Each program manager operates on a continuous agile development schedule producing new functionality at least once a month. Our software engineers receives roughly on average of 10 tickets per month; most are for minor bugs or cosmetic changes. Non “bug” tickets are required to be presented to each applications Configuration Control Board (CCB). Out of the 10 tickets, about 2-3 requests per week ranging from simple bug fixes or cosmetic adjustments; major rewrites range from about (1-2 per year). Each application must also be updated to meet current technology platform changes which equate to major re-writes every three years on average.

MFS has roughly 500-600 active daily users, T3 has approximately 300 active daily users, and MFR Manpower has approximately 200. MFS has right at 150,000 lines of code, while MFR Manpower has approximately 12,000; T3 system has approximately 100,000. In addition to the number of lines of codes, each system has a code quality range, which ranges from adequate to exceptional. These are mature systems which needs to be maintained while at the same time prepare to update to new technologies and help develop new features.

3+ years of engineering production code
Stack alignment isn’t a requirement, but you have the ability to learn and adapt to our tech stack: Ruby / React-Redux / GraphQL
A strong desire to be part of a dynamic team of engineers at all levels
Our Philosophy
Working for a successful smaller-size tech company is a lifestyle choice rather than a job choice. We believe every company can be successful with the right technology and that every individual can be with the right culture. We believe in collaboration - that working hand-in-hand brings the best thoughts to the table and creates an environment of learning and growth. Here, you’ll enjoy:
An intentionally engaging culture - ditch the silo!
Competitive pay and benefit options
Strong work-life balance as a focus of the company
The chance to learn from some of the best people in the business, including the company’s founders
A vibrant, collaborative and devoted team, who still makes time for fun

We believe that embracing the diversity of thought and perspective encourages collaboration that leads to product (and people!) innovation, diverse products and a successful business.",4.7,"Mavenlink

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box.
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!",4.1,"Cisco Systems - Engineering - Software

Description
Framebridge is a fast-growing company that is revolutionizing the $4 billion custom framing industry. Existing custom framing options are time-consuming, complex, and expensive; many people never get around to custom framing their favorite art or photos at all. We are changing all that with a curated and streamlined process along with modernized tech and manufacturing.

We make it simple and affordable to custom frame the things you love.


The problems we solve on the engineering team span eCommerce, manufacturing, logistics, and data analysis. We strive to create unique and intuitive experiences that allow customers to frame their art using powerful and easy-to-use products. We also create the tools, systems, and processes to empower our own employees in constructing great frames and an experience that customers love.

We work on continuously delivering products and iterative improvements. Along the way we keep learning and growing as a team and individuals, prototyping and experimenting to expand our capabilities. As part of a small company, each member of our team has opportunities for leadership and guiding the evolution of products we create.

Technology is key to improving custom framing.


Our current core technologies include Spree Commerce, Ruby/Rails, VueJS, PostgreSQL, AWS infrastructure, and Kubernetes. We are always on the lookout for the best ways to better empower our employees and customers while sustainably maintaining our codebase and team.

Sr Software Engineer, Team Lead


We are looking for an experienced Sr Software Engineer to lead a cross-functional product team, building web applications and integrations to help customers and employees design and manufacture frames. The focus of eCommerce vs Manufacturing will be based on the candidate's experience and team fit. This candidate can be based out of either our DC Georgetown office or our Richmond, KY manufacturing facility.

Example eCommerce projects for the team include developing streamlined frame design processes for customers, modeling new merchandise options like mat captions, and building off-site purchase integration with Instagram. Manufacturing work projects bridge eCommerce and Retail into the world of manufacturing frames, such as inventory transfers between facilities, integrating with new CNC and Laser etching machines, and facility-capability directed manufacturing work scheduling.
Desired Traits
8+ years overall professional experience in a collaborative team setting
Experience leading an agile team, supervising developers and helping them grow through direct mentorship and management
Experience architecting Ruby/Rails projects
Experience with eCommerce platforms such as Spree, Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce

We research new technology and design patterns in collaboration with fellow engineers to determine what will benefit us now and into the foreseeable future
Who we are looking for
Seasoned experience. 5+ years of web-based and mobile enterprise software development.
Research and communication. We solve problems. Before that can happen we need to understand the problem and the proposed solution.
Iterate and validate ideas. There are many different ways to solve a problem. There is a huge difference between ""It's working"" and ""It's the right solution"". We want the right answer, not just any answer. To achieve this, we research solutions and iterate on them with key members of our team for validation of our ideas.
Quality standards and scalability. We have to be able to deliver on what we come up with. We need to be able to code our solutions following best practices and company standards.
Collaborate and growth mindset. Iterating and being able to come up with a solution makes half of a developer. We need to be able to work through other people's solutions. We need to provide constructive feedback that makes not only our products better, but ultimately our developers better too.
Characteristics we are looking for and value in candidates
You are smart
You also get it wrong but know its ok and don't blame others
You understand the cycles of developer life
You are flexible and open to others' ideas and solutions, not just your own

About RMS

There’s a 1% chance an earthquake will cause $50 billion of insured loss within the next 12 months and a 5% chance that a hurricane will cause $60 billion of insured losses next year. At RMS, we turn risks into real numbers. How? By building simulation models that allow insurers and investors to understand and manage their global risks--from hurricanes, quakes, and wildfires, to cyberattacks, terror attacks, and pandemics. Why? We want to build a more resilient world, and we’re on a mission to help make every risk known.

Insurers, reinsurers, investors, financial institutions, governments, and NGOs trust RMS solutions to better understand and manage catastrophe risks. RMS was founded in 1989 by Stanford scientists who created our first model for California Earthquake. Today, RMS has some 1,300 employees across 13 offices in the US, London, Bermuda, Zurich, India, China, Japan, Singapore, and Australia, and over 1,000 products and models now covering six continents.

RMS helped pioneer the natural catastrophe model market we now lead – and we continue to innovate. In May 2019, we announced RMS Risk Intelligence™ (RI), an open-standard platform for strategic risk management. Through this purpose-built platform, clients can tap into RMS HD models, rich data layers, intuitive applications and APIs that simply integrate into existing enterprise systems to support business decisions across underwriting, risk selection, mitigation, and portfolio management.

Inclusive culture. Our customers come from all backgrounds, from all around the world. We're committed to building an actively inclusive and progressive work environment that makes Cleverific an excellent home for everyone.

Rather than participate in tedious planning and estimate exercises, you'll learn about the full context of the project and take ownership for ensuring that the work gets done. You'll be expected to take responsibilities for the stated priorities of your projects while keeping in mind the needs of the team beyond your own role.

Focus time. We hate meetings. On most days, our office is just a nice quiet place with minimal interruptions so you can focus on getting your best work done and collaborate with whoever you need to.

We’re committed generalists, eager learners, conscientious workers, and curators of what’s essential. Our workplace and our benefits are designed to support a sustainable, healthy relationship with your work.

COVID-19 precaution: Due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, our hiring process will now be completely virtual. All interviews and onboarding activities will be held online or over the phone. We remain committed to putting our people, customers, and communities first and appreciate your patience and flexibility as we work through this.
The (quality) doctor is in.
Modio has streamlined the convoluted and messy process that is healthcare credentialing and saved countless years of manual and error-prone work in the process. As part of CHG Healthcare we are working to drastically improve the speed (and quality) of credentialing to ensure that our doctors can spend more time treating (millions) of patients each year and less time dealing with credentialing headaches.
Our industry is growing and demand is high. This means you’ll have plenty of opportunities to grow and develop in your career. Keeping healthcare healthy can be as fun as it is rewarding.
We are open to this role being in our offices in Salt Lake City, Utah or San Francisco, California.
Your role:
Our Carbon platform is used to standardize healthcare credentialing data from hundreds of disparate and non-standardized data sources across the deep web. Your role as a senior engineer on the Carbon team spans many different technical disciplines, but the overarching goals are straightforward:
Use automation to detect and fix broken data integrations.
Make it easy for junior developers to write robust and resilient data integrations.
Standardize previously unstandardized (and often confusing) data.
A little about our tech stack:
AWS
CloudFormation/Terraform
Kubernetes/Istio
js/TypeScript
If you’re an ambitious reliability-oriented engineer who plays well with others AND can say yes to all of these statements, we are looking for you!
If you could dress up as anything for Halloween, you’d dress up as the open-closed principle.
You are a doer. Whether you are coming up with projects that align with our vision or helping others do the same, you are doing it proactively.
You understand how to design software and systems that are maintainable, robust, easy to understand, and capable of scaling. You also know that not every solution needs to be over-engineered.
You should be able to debug technical issues, even if the issue isn’t from “your code” or “your system”.
You don’t reinvent the wheel every time you build something new.
You can explain complex ideas in plain and simple language (most of the time).
Your qualifications:
5+ years’ experience as a site reliability engineer (or equivalent). Must understand things like caching, web scraping, exponential backoff, serverless, and rate limiting.
Professional experience working on backend API code (Node.js/TypeScript Preferred but not a hard requirement). Familiarity with defensive coding practices a must!
Experience working with serverless functions.
Experience with application metrics using StatsD/Prometheus/etc.
Experience managing on-call rotations and responding to support incidents.
Experience with container technologies such as Docker or Kubernetes.
Experience designing and building APIs.
Experience working on a scrum team in an agile environment.
Experience mentoring junior engineers and performing code reviews.
(Preferred) BA/BS degree in computer science/software engineering.

Why Cisco:

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!",4.1,"Cisco Systems - Engineering - Software

We remain committed to putting our people, customers, and communities first and appreciate your patience and flexibility as we work through this.
The (quality) doctor is in.
Modio has streamlined the convoluted and messy process that is healthcare credentialing and saved countless years of manual and error-prone work in the process. As part of CHG Healthcare we are working to drastically improve the speed (and quality) of credentialing to ensure that our doctors can spend more time treating (millions) of patients each year and less time dealing with credentialing headaches.
Our industry is growing and demand is high. This means you’ll have plenty of opportunities to grow and develop in your career. Keeping healthcare healthy can be as fun as it is rewarding.
We are open to this role being in our offices in Salt Lake City, Utah or San Francisco, California.
Your role:
Our Carbon platform is used to standardize healthcare credentialing data from hundreds of disparate and non-standardized data sources across the deep web. Your role as a senior engineer on the Carbon team spans many different technical disciplines, but the overarching goals are straightforward:

If you could dress up as anything for Halloween, you’d dress up as the open-closed principle.
You are a doer. Whether you are coming up with projects that align with our vision or helping others do the same, you are doing it proactively.
You understand how to design software and systems that are maintainable, robust, easy to understand, and capable of scaling. You also know that not every solution needs to be over-engineered.
You should be able to debug technical issues, even if the issue isn’t from “your code” or “your system”.
You don’t reinvent the wheel every time you build something new.
You can explain complex ideas in plain and simple language (most of the time).
Your qualifications:
5+ years’ experience as a site reliability engineer (or equivalent). Must understand things like caching, web scraping, exponential backoff, serverless, and rate limiting.
Professional experience working on backend API code (Node.js/TypeScript Preferred but not a hard requirement). Familiarity with defensive coding practices a must!

Experience managing on-call rotations and responding to support incidents.
Experience with container technologies such as Docker or Kubernetes.

Currently there are 4 data exchanges, 3 are one-directional (incoming) and one interface is bi-directional. Once the data is received, MFS runs an integration processing job to prepare this data for end users every morning. On average annually, the MFS programming cycle includes 3-4 major projects (greater than two weeks design phase – 4 weeks in the development phase) and roughly 8 minor projects (under two weeks in duration). The new development requirements range from cosmetic modifications to major modular rewrites based on the prioritization of the MARFORRES MFS Configuration Control Board. In addition, there are several items that fall outside of the normal System Development Life Cycle that require support such as: COOP preparation, ADHOC reporting support, system/network troubleshooting, and tasks required to maintain the system’s Authority to Operate (ATO). The contractor should be familiar with T-SQL DB and ASP.NET Web Forms in VB to work within the MFS program.

MARFORRES G-3/5 is responsible for managing a financial database that integrates Operating Budgets with training and exercises, which result in resource utilization over time. Resources are defined as units and their associated personnel, equipment, and funding. The MARFORRES G-3/5 Department provides budgeting, accounting, execution and financial support services through the T3 Database to four Major Subordinate Commands (4th Marine Aircraft Wing, 4th Marine Division, 4th Marine Logistics Group, and the Force Headquarters Group) in addition to many major programs managed at the headquarter level. A major challenge facing the MARFORRES G-3/5 is the geographical dispersion of the more than 160 sites throughout the United States.

The MFR IRR Management Application is a web based system designed to maintain accurate and current personnel records on members of the Individual Ready Reserve Components, to include mailing address, physical condition, military qualifications, dependency status, civilian occupational skills, availability for service, and other information that is needed to determine strength levels of the Military Services. Below outlines the current operating environment for this task area:

Currently Microsoft Visual Studio is used to develop the code, and Azure DevOps server for version control, testing and release management capabilities. The development team in coordination with the Marine Forces Reserve Server/Network personnel to conduct the user acceptance testing, performance, and load testing of the applications. Release notes are published to the home page of each application. Currently there are no set monthly release scheduled for changes to production. In the current environment MFR follows an agile schema, sprints are anywhere from 2-6 weeks, and depends on the complexity of the project.

The demands on each application translate to a functionality backlog of 50-100 items varying in levels of complexity. Each program manager operates on a continuous agile development schedule producing new functionality at least once a month. Our software engineers receives roughly on average of 10 tickets per month; most are for minor bugs or cosmetic changes. Non “bug” tickets are required to be presented to each applications Configuration Control Board (CCB). Out of the 10 tickets, about 2-3 requests per week ranging from simple bug fixes or cosmetic adjustments; major rewrites range from about (1-2 per year). Each application must also be updated to meet current technology platform changes which equate to major re-writes every three years on average.

MFS has roughly 500-600 active daily users, T3 has approximately 300 active daily users, and MFR Manpower has approximately 200. MFS has right at 150,000 lines of code, while MFR Manpower has approximately 12,000; T3 system has approximately 100,000. In addition to the number of lines of codes, each system has a code quality range, which ranges from adequate to exceptional. These are mature systems which needs to be maintained while at the same time prepare to update to new technologies and help develop new features.

About RMS

There’s a 1% chance an earthquake will cause $50 billion of insured loss within the next 12 months and a 5% chance that a hurricane will cause $60 billion of insured losses next year. At RMS, we turn risks into real numbers. How? By building simulation models that allow insurers and investors to understand and manage their global risks--from hurricanes, quakes, and wildfires, to cyberattacks, terror attacks, and pandemics. Why? We want to build a more resilient world, and we’re on a mission to help make every risk known.

Insurers, reinsurers, investors, financial institutions, governments, and NGOs trust RMS solutions to better understand and manage catastrophe risks. RMS was founded in 1989 by Stanford scientists who created our first model for California Earthquake. Today, RMS has some 1,300 employees across 13 offices in the US, London, Bermuda, Zurich, India, China, Japan, Singapore, and Australia, and over 1,000 products and models now covering six continents.

Through this purpose-built platform, clients can tap into RMS HD models, rich data layers, intuitive applications and APIs that simply integrate into existing enterprise systems to support business decisions across underwriting, risk selection, mitigation, and portfolio management.

How we understand and manage risk affects everyone and our passion is nothing less than creating a more resilient world through a better understanding of catastrophic events.

ASML is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of lithography systems that help enable Moore’s Law and the creation of increasingly powerful and capable electronic devices. Our San Diego-based light source division, Cymer, is renowned for developing both deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography light sources and next generation extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light sources.As the world’s leading semiconductor equipment manufacturer, ASML enables chipmakers to produce cheaper, speedier chips – and to produce them faster – thereby enabling all the technology you use today. The systems we produce integrate several large and sophisticated machines, themselves each a feat of engineering innovation, precision, and speed.

We are a multinational company with over 70 locations in 16 countries, headquartered in Veldhoven, the Netherlands. We have 18 office locations around the United States including main offices in Wilton, CT, Chandler, AZ, San Jose, CA and San Diego, CA (EUV laser source creation).

In the Cymer Light Source (CLS) division in San Diego, we design and manufacture Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) lasers, used directly in the chipmaking process. Far from a basic “consumer” laser, these machines are complex, powerful, and flexible. The lasers we make require: durable and high-speed precise motion-controlled optics to maintain wavelength to femtometer accuracy under high laser powers; advanced materials to endure the harsh Fluorine-rich environments and high powers; clever mechanical designs to allow high performance and fit all the parts within a confined space, but still allow easy manufacturing and servicing.

If you have a passion for technology and innovation you’ll want to check us out. Be a part of progress.

One Company, One Goal, Limitless Innovation. It's our people that make the difference.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

=== WHY CISCO ===

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Why Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

ASML is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of lithography systems that help enable Moore’s Law and the creation of increasingly powerful and capable electronic devices. Our San Diego-based light source division, Cymer, is renowned for developing both deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography light sources and next generation extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light sources.As the world’s leading semiconductor equipment manufacturer, ASML enables chipmakers to produce cheaper, speedier chips – and to produce them faster – thereby enabling all the technology you use today. The systems we produce integrate several large and sophisticated machines, themselves each a feat of engineering innovation, precision, and speed.

We are a multinational company with over 70 locations in 16 countries, headquartered in Veldhoven, the Netherlands. We have 18 office locations around the United States including main offices in Wilton, CT, Chandler, AZ, San Jose, CA and San Diego, CA (EUV laser source creation).

In the Cymer Light Source (CLS) division in San Diego, we design and manufacture Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) lasers, used directly in the chipmaking process. Far from a basic “consumer” laser, these machines are complex, powerful, and flexible. The lasers we make require: durable and high-speed precise motion-controlled optics to maintain wavelength to femtometer accuracy under high laser powers; advanced materials to endure the harsh Fluorine-rich environments and high powers; clever mechanical designs to allow high performance and fit all the parts within a confined space, but still allow easy manufacturing and servicing.

Why Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

ASML is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of lithography systems that help enable Moore’s Law and the creation of increasingly powerful and capable electronic devices. Our San Diego-based light source division, Cymer, is renowned for developing both deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography light sources and next generation extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light sources.As the world’s leading semiconductor equipment manufacturer, ASML enables chipmakers to produce cheaper, speedier chips – and to produce them faster – thereby enabling all the technology you use today. The systems we produce integrate several large and sophisticated machines, themselves each a feat of engineering innovation, precision, and speed.

We are a multinational company with over 70 locations in 16 countries, headquartered in Veldhoven, the Netherlands. We have 18 office locations around the United States including main offices in Wilton, CT, Chandler, AZ, San Jose, CA and San Diego, CA (EUV laser source creation).

In the Cymer Light Source (CLS) division in San Diego, we design and manufacture Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) lasers, used directly in the chipmaking process. Far from a basic “consumer” laser, these machines are complex, powerful, and flexible. The lasers we make require: durable and high-speed precise motion-controlled optics to maintain wavelength to femtometer accuracy under high laser powers; advanced materials to endure the harsh Fluorine-rich environments and high powers; clever mechanical designs to allow high performance and fit all the parts within a confined space, but still allow easy manufacturing and servicing.

If you have a passion for technology and innovation you’ll want to check us out. Be a part of progress.
