At Gainsight, we don't believe in doing things as a ""means to an end."" Life's too short to have anything short of a joyful work environment that we passionately believe in.

Child-like Joy: We aspire to experience child-like joy in our work and lives, injecting a spirit of passion, optimism and laughter into everything that we do.
Shoshin: We believe in a beginner's mind. Don't surround yourself with people like you--diversity breeds creativity.
Stay Thirsty, My Friends: We believe in a totally internally-driven strive for greatness. The solution is think more, not doing more.
Why You'll Love It Here
Our Attitude: We've created a new industry from scratch, and we're on the fast track!
Our Leadership: We offer the leading tech solution for driving Customer Success.
Our ROI: Reduce customer churn, increase up-sell, and improve customer satisfaction.
Our Technology: Deep Salesforce.com hooks, predictive analytics, and a beautiful user interface.
Our Impact: We help our customers make millions of dollars more per year.
Our Clients: Big companies like Box, Adobe, Marketo, and many others.
Our Team: Tech all-stars from Facebook, Box, and others (and top consulting firms like BCG and McKinsey!).
Our Values: They are unique - Golden Rule, Success for All, Childlike Joy, Shoshin, and Stay Thirsty, My Friends
Our Office: If you showed up one day, you might find anything from karaoke performances to mini-golf championships.

User interface design may not be your gift, but you’ve realized that users expect more; you’ve taken steps to improve the user experience of your applications
Project managers appreciate the way you provide guidance while always considering project limitations. They love working with you!

That’s just year one. Our consultants have gone on to lead incident responses, build enterprise systems, develop open source initiatives, and open offices in brand new markets.

Child-like Joy: We aspire to experience child-like joy in our work and lives, injecting a spirit of passion, optimism and laughter into everything that we do.
Shoshin: We believe in a beginner's mind. Don't surround yourself with people like you--diversity breeds creativity.
Stay Thirsty, My Friends: We believe in a totally internally-driven strive for greatness. The solution is think more, not doing more.
Why You'll Love It Here
Our Attitude: We've created a new industry from scratch, and we're on the fast track!

Credit unions are run by democratically elected and volunteer Board of Directors; it's democracy in action for the people by the people!

Why Us?

We offer great benefits including medical, dental, vision, a flex spending account (FSA), 401(k), paid holidays, sick leave, generous vacation accrual, life insurance, tuition reimbursement, an employee assistance program (EAP), a wellbeing program, a fitness room at the corporate office, public transportation reimbursement, and more.You will join a culture that invests in people and empowers success!

Over the past decade, Success Academies has grown faster than any charter network in the nation, building a vibrant network of 47 elementary, middle and high schools. Our ~16,000 children mostly poor and minority are out-performing students at top city and suburban schools across New York State. Our goals for our second decade are even more ambitious: to grow to 100 schools and to educate 50,000 children across New York City in a uniquely holistic pre-k-12 system, bringing transformational change here and across the country. At 100 schools, we will graduate 3,000 scholars each year who are prepared to enter, persist and graduate from college and eventually to lead in business, government and civic realms.

Scaling schooling excellence as we rapidly grow is an imperative. To further position the organization to do this, Success Academies is prioritizing the continued build out of a scalable, technology enabled model for operating and managing its schools by establishing a School Management Services capability that is intended to deliver an enhanced set of services to better support our network schools.
